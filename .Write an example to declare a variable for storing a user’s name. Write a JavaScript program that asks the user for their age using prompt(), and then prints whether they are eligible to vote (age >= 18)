Here's an example of a JavaScript program that declares a variable to store a user's name, asks for their age using prompt(), and then checks if they are eligible to vote:
// Declare a variable to store the user's name
let userName = prompt("Please enter your name:");

// Ask the user for their age
let userAge = prompt("Hello " + userName + ", please enter your age:");

// Convert the age to a number
userAge = Number(userAge);

// Check if the user is eligible to vote
if (userAge >= 18) {
    console.log(userName + ", you are eligible to vote!");
} else {
    console.log(userName + ", you are not eligible to vote yet.");
}
The program prompts the user for their name and stores it in the userName variable.
It then prompts the user for their age and stores that in userAge.
The age is converted to a number to allow for comparison.
Finally, it checks if the age is 18 or older and prints a message to the console accordingly.
You can run this code in the console of a web browser.
