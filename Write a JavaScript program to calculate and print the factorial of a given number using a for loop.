Hereâ€™s a JavaScript program that calculates and prints the factorial of a given number using a for loop:

javascript
// Function to calculate the factorial of a number
function factorial(n) {
    let result = 1; // Initialize result

    // Use a for loop to calculate factorial
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        result *= i; // Multiply result by i
    }

    return result; // Return the final result
}

// Example usage
let number = 5; // Change this number to calculate a different factorial
let fact = factorial(number);
console.log("The factorial of " + number + " is: " + fact);
Explanation:
Function Declaration: The factorial(n) function takes a number n as input.
Initialization: A variable result is initialized to 1.
For Loop: The loop runs from 1 to n, multiplying result by each number i.
Return Statement: After the loop, the final result is returned.
Example Usage: The program calculates the factorial of 5 (you can change this number) and prints it to the console.
You can run this code in a web browser console or any JavaScript environment!
