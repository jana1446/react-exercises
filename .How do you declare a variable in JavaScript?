In JavaScript, you can declare a variable using three keywords: var, let, and const. Here's how each works:

Using var:

javascript
var myVariable = 10;
Using let:

javascript
Copy code
let myVariable = 20;
Using const:

javascript
const myVariable = 30;
var is function-scoped and can be redeclared.
let is block-scoped and cannot be redeclared in the same scope.
const is also block-scoped but is used for variables that wonâ€™t be reassigned.
Choose the one that fits your needs based on scope and reassignability!
